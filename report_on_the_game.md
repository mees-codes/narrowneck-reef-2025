# Reporting on 'Game' #



## Preference Curve ##

During the first session of playing 'The Game', we decided to adjust our preference lines. After our initial runs, we concluded that the preference funtions for cost and ride length should not be linear. For the Gold Coast City Council the following holds; Since there is always an initial fixed cost associated with any civil project, and assuming that the Gold Coast City Council already has a predetermined estimate for the projectâ€™s total cost, we reasoned that the cost preference line should decrease relatively little at first, before dropping rapidly once the cost exceeds a certain treshhold.

The first increases of ride lentgh are more preferd than later inscreases. For example; an increase of wave length from 300 meters to 350 meters is not that great of an improvement where an increase of 50 meters to 100 meters is seen as a huge improvement since the wave length is doubbled. 


## Findings ##


### Optimal wave length for surfing ###
The surfing community has a relatively small impact on the model because they have only 13% of weight. Their preference score on the otherhand is extremely high. An optimal design for other stakeholders happens to have an amazing wave length for surfing. Meaning that the surfing community will benefit from the weights of other stakeholders by getting great wave length without having much impact on the overall model. 

### Safety ###
Safety scores high in the optimal model, almost regardless of the influnces (weights) of each stakeholder. This is comes form result that the other stakeholder also prefer a deep reef. 

-- **Marcus and/or Malte** write why it the model always gives a deep reef as optimal!!!!! --

And the most important factor for safety is the reef depth. If this is always deep, safety will always scrore high.

### Sediment trapping 



### Cost and Economic growth ###
After iterating a couple times the model give a relust which give the direable outcome for all, essecialy ride lenght, sediment trapping and safty. The final tension in the model is between the cost and economic growth. Tuning only the weights of cost and economic growth now basically result in a 1 on 1 trade-off in preferefereces, e.g. cost=50 & growth=60 or cost=35 & growth=75.As the city council will also profit form local economic growth the direct question present it self. How much to invest?

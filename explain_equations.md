Objective 2:

For the Length
- The length of the ride increases linearly as the reef length increases, however as the length of the ride is not exactly the lngth of the reef it instead is often 3/4 the length

For the Depth
- The depth of the reef effects the quality of the wave, hence we get a parabolic negative effect on the length of the ride. As the reef depth diveregs from the optimal depth (cons6) of 2m the wave quality grades as as such is divided by the right hand side of the equation. Cons5 is simply a varibale of sensivtity of how much the wave dgrades as the reef depht diverges.

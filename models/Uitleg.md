# Reporting on 'Game' #



## Preference Curve ##

During the first session of playing 'The Game', we decided to adjust our preference lines. In our initial runs, we noticed that the preference lines for cost and ride length should not be linear. For the Gold Coast City Council the following holds; Since there is always an initial fixed cost associated with any civil project, and assuming that the Gold Coast City Council already has a predetermined estimate for the projectâ€™s total cost, we reasoned that the cost preference line would remain relatively constant at first, before dropping rapidly once the cost exceeds a certain threshold.

A small increase in wave length does not improve the overall wave length preference after reaching a threshold length. For example; an increase of wave length from 300 meters to 350 meters is not that great of an improvement where an increase of 50 meters to 100 meters is seen as a huge improvement since the wave length is doubbled.

## Findings ##

### Optimal wave length for surfing ###
The surfing community has a relatively small impact on the model because they have only 13% of weight. Their preference score on the otherhand is extremely high. An optimal design for other stakeholders happens to have an amazing wave length for surfing. Meaning that the surfing community will benefit from the weights of other stakeholders by getting great wave length without having much impact on the overall model.

# narrowneck-reef-2025
## Questions:
- Which solver do we need to use for our 'game' and design, minmax or tetra?
- What is the correct way to fix the difference between 100 preference and max posible values?
- What could be logical constraint for a artifical reef?
- Mean value of tetra solver is now positive and decreasing, that seem good. But initial pos stays at -100.00. Is this okay?
- How to implement that city coucil has more than 1 interest?
- Why do we get different results every run?
## To do's:
- Check/fix formula for tourism. Now is kinda of inversly related to sedement trapping. But probably shouldn't be like that.
- Fix constraint, is reef now on the beach?
- Is it logical that the optimal angle is the minimum?
